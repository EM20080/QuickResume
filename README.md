## HEAVY WIP: Current Limitations

> This tool currently functions only with simple applications. **Do not expect compatibility with complex or large-scale games yet.**

## To-Do List

* **Persistent RAM State Loading**
  Enable loading of saved RAM states even after the target application has been closed. *(1/4)*

* **Cross-Application Validation**
  Implement compatibility checks to reject RAM states that don’t match the current target (e.g., prevent loading a God of War dump into another game). *(2/4)*

* **LZ4 Compression Support**
  Integrate LZ4 compression for RAM dumps and implement in-memory decompression during load. *(3/4)*

* **Game Compatibility**
  Extend functionality to support various games reliably and efficiently. *(4/4)*
